## 3 Text and narrative
## automatic writing: a very simple linguistic parsing tree example

* Techniques: text sorting, automatic and generative poetry, interactive story structure
* Ideas: Grammar and variation
* Demo: tree parsing text

this simple example loads lexicons of parts of speech (noun, verb, adjective etc) and constructs gramatically correct (sometimes...) sentences based upon a simple set of sentence construction rules.

This system is similar to much more complex ones used in areas of 'computational linguistics' and is often used in reverse with text analysis of existing writing or speech to generate hidden markov models from corpuses of speech. Lexicons are stored in a 2D vector 'textParts' that we parse based upon orders of 'parts of speech' in a vector of sentence structures 'textStructure'
